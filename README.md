# React Dashboard Project

This is a mockup project for a React dashboard built using Sass/SCSS. It provides a basic structure and design for a dashboard interface, and additional features will be added in the future.

The project is currently live on Vercel. You can access the dashboard and login page using the following links:

- [Dashboard](https://react-dashboard-xi-sandy.vercel.app/app)
- [Login](https://react-dashboard-xi-sandy.vercel.app)

To log in, you can use any email and password as there is no authentication implemented in the current version of the project.

## Installation

To run this project locally, please follow the instructions below:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/react-dashboard-project.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd react-dashboard-project
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

## Usage

To start the development server and view the dashboard, use the following command:
```
npm start
```

This will start the development server and open the dashboard in your default browser. Any changes you make to the source code will be automatically reflected in the browser.

## Project Structure

The project structure is organized as follows:

```
react-dashboard-project/
  ├── src/
  │   ├── components/       # Contains reusable components
  │   ├── styles/           # Contains global styles and SCSS files
  │   ├── App.js            # Main application component
  │   └── index.js          # Entry point of the application
  ├── public/               # Public assets (e.g., index.html, images)
  ├── package.json          # Project dependencies and scripts
  └── README.md             # Project readme file (you are here)
```

## Customization

The styles for the dashboard are defined using Sass/SCSS. You can customize the design and appearance by modifying the SCSS files located in the `src/styles` directory.

## Future Features

This project is currently a mockup and may lack some features. However, we have plans to add the following features in future updates:

- User authentication and authorization
- Integration with backend APIs
- Customizable settings and preferences

Stay tuned for updates as we continue to enhance this React dashboard project!
